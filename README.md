👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a Computer Engineering student at the Federal University of Ceará (UFC) with a deep interest in building robust and efficient systems from the ground up. My passion lies in understanding the full stack, from designing digital logic in Verilog to writing low-level operating system code in Assembly. I am driven by the challenge of creating technology that is both powerful and reliable.

🚀 My Pinned Projects

Here are a few projects that showcase my skills in digital design, embedded systems, and low-level software development.

🏆 Academic Research & Contributions
In addition to my project work, I have also contributed to academic research in the field of digital circuit reliability.

📄 Co-Author of a research paper accepted at SBCCI 2025

Title: “Auto-Tuning Aging Sensor Validated Under Burn-In, Temperature, and Voltage Variations”

I contributed to the development and experimental validation of an on-chip, self-tuning aging sensor designed for long-term circuit reliability. My work involved implementing Verilog modules and Python automation scripts for the validation on an Artix-7 FPGA, advancing concepts in Silicon Lifecycle Management (SLM).
